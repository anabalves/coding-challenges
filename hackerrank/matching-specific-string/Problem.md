# Matching Specific String

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is mainly used for string pattern matching.

In this challenge, your task is to find how many times the word `hackerrank` appears in a given block of text. The match must be **case-sensitive** and **exact** â€” no variations allowed.

### Function Signature

```java
int countOccurrences(String input, String word)
```

### Parameters

- `input`: a string that may contain multiple lines of text
- `word`: the exact word to match using regular expressions (for this problem, it will always be `"hackerrank"`)

### Returns

- `int`: total number of exact, case-sensitive matches of `word` found in `input`

---

### Input Format

- The input consists of one or more lines of text.

---

### Constraints

- Only lowercase `hackerrank` should be matched â€” other variations like `HackerRank` or `Hackerrank` should not match.

### Explanation

The word `hackerrank` appears exactly two times in the input string. Since the matching is case-sensitive and exact, only those two are counted.
