# 🚀 Coding Challenges

Welcome to my **Coding Challenges** repository!  
This is a curated collection of my solutions to programming challenges from various platforms. These exercises help me improve my algorithmic thinking, master data structures, and explore problem-solving techniques in multiple languages.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each platform is organized into its own folder. Inside, you'll find individual subfolders per challenge, each containing:
- `Problem.md`: The problem description or summary.
- `Solution.java` (or other languages): My solution to the challenge.

└── README.md
```

## 🧠 Challenge Categories

These challenges cover areas such as:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** – arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.
- **Mathematics & Number Theory** – primes, combinatorics, modular arithmetic, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – principles, modeling, and design patterns.
- **Functional Programming** – pure functions, recursion, immutability, etc.
- **Web & API** – REST APIs, backend logic, and input/output processing.

## 🌍 Platforms

Solutions are sourced from:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anabalves/coding-challenges.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the platform and challenge folder you're interested in.

3. Open and run the solution files using your preferred IDE or terminal.

> Some folders may include a `Problem.md` for context, especially when platforms don't allow direct export.
